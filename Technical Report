## Predicting Totals Bets for NBA Games

Problem: This project attempts to predict whether an NBA game's total score will be over or under a predetermined total line, 
set by Las Vegas casinos. In sports betting, a bookkeaper will create a bet called a total on most team games. The total is set at the predicted total score for the game; with knowledge of this total, you are able to bet an "Over," betting that the total score of the game will be higher than the total set by the bookeaper, or you can bet an "Under," a number at which the bookkeaper believes will create action for both "Over" bets and "Under" bets. The goal of this project is to create a model which can discern some advantage/confidence in predicting these total bets, and then create a strategy to profit off of this information. 

Data: I decided to analyze the past 5 season of NBA games for the purposes of this project. The basketball data I scraped off of basketball-reference.com. With this data, I was able to create a list of dates which NBA games were played on in the past 5 seasons. 

Data Cleaning: Once I had both the historical NBA games data, and the historical betting totals data.
